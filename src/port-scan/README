This is simple port scanner using go

############
VERSION-1
############

This port scanner scans port on scanme.nmap.org. Prints if port connection was successful or not

############
VERSION-2
############

This port scanner scans ports on scanme.nmap.org. Prints if port connection was successful or not
It checks for all the ports from 1 to 1024 with simple for loop. It checks one by one and is
very slow. 

############
VERSION-3
############

This port scanner scans ports on scanme.nmap.org. Prints if port connection was successful or not
This version launches single go routine per connection, and the main go routine doesn't know to wait
for main connection to take place. Therefore, the code completes and exists as soon as the for loop 
finishes the iterations, which may be faster than the network exchange of packets between the code and 
target ports. We may not get accurate results for ports whose packets were still in-flight.
Let's try fixing this in new version.
